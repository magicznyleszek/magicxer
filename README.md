# sicx

Sick words mixer.

One word vs list of words -- combine and try to come up with clever mixes. For every word return a list and try to guess/suggest which one is prettier/best.

## Development

This is a small webapp project that I created to check out some fancy new tech:

* Parcel
* Vue.js
* Jest
* TypeScript
* Prettier
* 2 spaces indentation :-D
* .editorconfig

Note: The website is being built into `docs` directory, because Github Pages allows to serve only root or `docs`.
